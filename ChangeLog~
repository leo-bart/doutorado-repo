1. Purpose
***********************************************************
The present C++ code aims to simulate a freight railway wagon with and without
connected masses that represent the soloshin frequencies of a liquid cargo.

Changes
***********************************************************

** 2014.04.28
Corrected fluid mass inertia. Added some comments and spaces to clear the code.

Deleted the mmovingmass parameter that setted the amount of mass that could
move. This parameter had no sense whatsoever because moving masses were a
function of the sloshing frequencies.

The previous parameter was changed by the fillRatio parameter.
